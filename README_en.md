# USB-Host-Keyboard-ESP32-S2

üåç *[Portugu√™s](README.md) ‚àô [English](README_en.md)*

## Overview
This project implements a USB host keyboard using an ESP32-S2 microcontroller. It is designed to interface with USB keyboards and process their inputs.

## Features
- USB Keyboard host functionality
- Compatible with ESP32-S2 microcontrollers
- Modular design with separate components for easy customization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
